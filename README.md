# Cordic-Oscillator

CORDIC Oscillator in Verilog

This project implements a CORDIC-based Oscillator using Verilog. The design generates sine and cosine waveforms using the Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm.

📌 Features
- Verilog implementation of a pipelined CORDIC core
- Generates sinusoidal waveforms (sine & cosine)
- Configurable word length and number of pipeline stages
- Fully synthesizable on Xilinx FPGAs
- Testbench included for simulation in Xilinx ISim / Vivado

⚙️ How It Works
A phase accumulator generates a phase angle based on the input tuning word.
The CORDIC pipeline computes sine and cosine values for the given angle.
The outputs (sin_out, cos_out) can be observed in ISim Simulator as sinusoidal waveforms.

🚀 Usage
1. Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/Piyush1085/Cordic-Oscillator.git
cd Cordic-Oscillator

2. Open in Xilinx ISE / Vivado
Create a new project
Add src/*.v files as Design Sources
Add tb/*.v files as Simulation Sources

3. Run Simulation
Set tb_cordic_oscillator as the top module
Run behavioral simulation
Open ISim waveform viewer to view sine & cosine outputs

4. Expected Output
You should see sinusoidal waveforms (sin_out, cos_out) generated by the CORDIC oscillator.
🧪 Testbench Notes
Clock period: configurable (default 10ns → 100MHz)
Reset signal: active high
Tuning word controls the output frequency

📊 Applications
